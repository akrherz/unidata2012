.DISCUSSION...
THE REST OF THIS WEEK SHOULD SEE LITTLE CHANGE. VERY HOT
DAYS...TEMPERATURES ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE EARLY JULY
NORMALS...ARE EXPECTED WITH FEW CLOUDS. LATER IN THE WEEKEND AND
EARLY NEXT WEEK LONGER-TERM MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER RIDGE
OVER OKLAHOMA WILL SHIFT TO WEST OF THE ROCKIES. FOLLOWING THIS
SHIFT, THEY BRING A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO OKLAHOMA. THIS WILL
GIVE US A CHANCE FOR RAIN AND MORE SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES FOR AT
LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK. IT WILL LIKELY ALSO BE MORE
HUMID.
